## Managing Branches

 1. First make sure you're in development branch and have pulled all the latest changes. 
 2. Afterwards click on new branch and name it as this : YourName-TasksYouWillDo. (Please only make the branch when you're actually ready to start). 
    If you did make your branch before and you need to get the latest. Go to the github repository and click on pull request. Select from Development to your Branch
 3. Afterwards Publish your branch. 
 4. Once you've finished implementing all the features, Push your changes. 
 5. Afterwards, you'll see send pull request. This will take you to the github website. 
 6. You will need to select two reviewers. 
    (Programmer) one should be me and another should be a programmer that hasn't reviewed you previously.
    (Artist) one should be Ryan and another should be Gabi / Jenny. 
 7. Reviewers should take a look at every file being changed just to make sure it doesn't overlap with anyone else. 
    (Programmer) Try to look at the code and see what could be improved, what could be potentially be an issue. If a portion of the code is not understandable, please ask about       it.
8. Once your review is finished & approved. It will be merged into development by Ryan. Afterwards your branch will be deleted and have to repeat the steps mentioned before.
